## Introduction

We studied how agricultural trade has changed between 1993 and 2016, using data from the FAO (Food and Agriculture Organisation).

## Global Trade

Trade has increased so much between 1993 and 2016.

### New Trade Countries

Brazil has emerged as an exporter.

China has emerged as an importer.

Some products, little known in 1993, are now massively popular in different regions across the world.

## Countries

### China

China has become the biggest importer of agricultural product in the world.

China mostly imports soy, from Brazil and the USA.

They have grown to this position between 1993 and 2016

### Brazil

Brazil has emerged as one the worlds largest exporters.

They mostly trade with China.

They produce a lot of soy.

## Products

### Avocados

Avocados have become greatly popular.

They are mostly imported to the USA, from Mexico.

This wasn't the case in 1993.

Mexico was already an important exporter, but they exported mostly to Israel?

### Quinoa

Quinoa was totaly unknown in Western Europe and the USA in 1993.

It became a health food craze, and what was once a crop only eaten in Peru and Bolivia is now consumed in the whole world.

## Conclusions

Here are our conclusions.

Trade has changed.

Its great, but also sucks.
