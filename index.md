## Introduction

Food is not just food. Nowadays, people are aware that the source of your food is much more than just a label. Where food comes from defines the price. Your avocadoes crossed an ocean, they are going to be expensive. But a product’s origin can mean so much more. The food you produce has a carbon foot-print. Depending on the country, workers might not be treated humanely. Some countries, might even have diseases for specific crops, while other  countries don’t. Careful with that banana you bought at the airport, you wouldn’t want bananas to go extinct, again [LINK]. As 21st century “smart” consumers, we are aware that we should always ask ourselves the question: where does my food come from?

But have you ever asked yourself: why does my food comes from the places it does?

Here we look at examples of how various factors, from population growth to consumer demands, can affect the production and international trade of crops. Our aim is to show you how multiple factors have come together to change the global crop market over the past two decades. These global changes, ultimately have had surprising and often undesirable effects on individual countries.

## Global Trade

Since 1993, the type of crops are traded have not changed much. Despite what social media might make you believe, super-food have not completely changed what people produce, trade, and consume. Since 1993, the most traded products have by far been wheat, maize, and soybean. While these are staple foods throughout the world, they are not consumed more than other staples like potatoes and rice {LINK}. The real driver behind the trade of these three products is animal feed. INSERT(What percent is used for animal feed).

However, who exports and who imports crops has significantly shifted in the past two decades.

China has become the primary importer of agricultural products by tonnes on the planet, while brazil has risen as a major producer and exporter.

## Countries

### China

We have seen that China has become the largest importer of agricultural products in the world. But how exactly has China's imports changed? Here is a look at total Chinese imports, between 1993 and 2016.

As we can see Chinese imports skyrocket but their exports stay more or less stable. But what do they import? Here are the 5 products most imported in China in 2016, and their evolution since 1993. Here is a stackplot of imports.

What do they use it for?

To feed pigs.

Why do they import it?

Due to policies. They do not want to depend on imports for grain.

How has their total production changed in that time?

Production increases, but not for soy.

How have their exports changed?

They haven't.

### Brazil

Brazil has emerged as one the worlds largest exporters.

They mostly trade with China.

They produce a lot of soy.

How has their arable land increased?

Where did it increase? (Amazon duh)

## Products

### Avocados

We start by looking at how the trade of avocados has changed from 1993 to 2016.

The first thing that catches our attention is the increase of the Avocados exported from Mexico to the US. Back to 1993, the main exporter of Avocados to the US was Chile, while most of the exports from Mexico went to Europe. The United States had banned  avocados in 1994 to eliminate the threat of Mexican pests, such as the fruit fly. But in 1994, with the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), Mexican avocados entered the American market, alongside Californian avocados that had sustained the country throughout the existence of the ban. An avocado explosion followed: in 2016, 76% of the total exports of Avocados from Mexico went to the US, compared to only 13% in 1994. However, despite this increase in Mexicos’s avocados production, ** can Mexico handle the demand of imports to the US? Mexico seems to be facing a “[guacamole crisis](<https://www.dw.com/en/mexico-facing-a-guacamole-crisis/a-49703429>)".

** from almost 800 thousand Tonnes in 1994 to 1890 thounsands in 2016

In the EU the demand of Avocados has also explote: from 170 thousands of tonnes in 1994  to 1810 thousands of imports in 2016 (from outside the EU). The main exporters appear to be South Africa, Mexico, Israel and Kenya, and in the most recent years Peru and Chile.

Let’s look deeper into the countries of the EU. If we take a look to the imports, traditionally France was the largest importer, along with the United Kingdom, Germany, the Nehterlands and Spain. Scandinavian countries such as Denmark and Sweeden are much smaller in terms of population, but still appear as one of the highest consumers of avocados due to their strong promotion and the attention to health food.

Spain is the most important producer of avocados in Europe. It was the main exporter of avocados until 2006, when the Netherlands got first in the rank, along with their increase in imports. The Netherlands is the main non-producing exporter of avocados in the world. From there, large volumes are re-exported mainly to countries inside the EU. In 2016, 28.9% of their exports were to Germany, followed by France (10.5%) and Sweden (8%).

### Quinoa

Beyond governmental policies, consumer can be a major driving force for agricultural trade. Trending products such as quinoa have become 

The majority of quinoa exports are towards first world economies, mainly the United States and Europe. Quinoa is native to the andean plateau, meaning only Ecuador, Bolivia, and Peru have the adequate climate cultivate it. Until 2010, Worldwide quinoa exports remained under QUANTITY. Bolivia was the major exporter the US and EU, while Peru supplied to these two, and to smaller markets such as Japan, Australia, and New Zealand. 

## Conclusions

Here are our conclusions.

Trade has changed.

Its great, but also sucks.

## TEXT

We all have heard about "globalization" and how it has changed the way we trade. Think about it, how much of the food you consume has been produced locally? Did people have acces to all these international products before? Have you ever seen your grandma (or grandpa) cooking this fancy thing called "quinoa" that flies from another country? Yes, GLOBALIZATION is a fact, but how is it really changing worldwide?

Do not be impatient, we are going to discover it! But, first of all...

**Has the production also increased over the past two decades?**

(GRAPH)

As you may have predicted, production has almost double: we are more habitants, so it seems pretty obvious, right? But oh man was going on with the trade... We have almost tripled it! Let's look a little bit deeper to find the ambitious countries that are importing soooo much.

(Import over the years map)

**From Japan to China!** In 1993 Japan was the country that had the most imports (in tonnes) compared to the rest of countries... but something has clearly changed: now China is the imports-Queen, but *Why?* Before answering, let's take a look to the exports...

(Export over years map)

The United States is still the main exporter, but one country seems to be increasingly joining the *let's export* trend: Brazil!

So we have seen changes in **China** and **Brazil**: any relationship within them? Let's analyze the main **trading routes** from 1993 to 2016

(Trading routes)

Back to 1993, main trade line: U.S.-Japan, from the main exporter to the main importer by the time. But one line trade seems to become more and more important over the years: **Brazil-China!** So yes, it seems that our new relevant exporter is trading a lot with the importer-Queen, but which kind of products?

And what about U.S. China?
