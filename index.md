Food is not just food. Nowadays, people are aware that the source of your food is much more than just a label. Where food comes from defines the price. Your avocadoes crossed an ocean, they are going to be expensive. But a product’s origin can mean so much more. The food you produce has a carbon foot-print. Depending on the country, workers might not be treated humanely. Some countries, might even have diseases for specific crops, while other  countries don’t. Careful with that banana you bought at the airport, you wouldn’t want bananas to go extinct, again [LINK]. As 21st century “smart” consumers, we are aware that we should always ask ourselves the question: where does my food come from?

But have you ever asked yourself: why does my food comes from the places it does?

Here we look at examples of how various factors, from population growth to consumer demands, can affect the production and international trade of crops. Our aim is to show you how multiple factors have come together to change the global crop market over the past two decades. These global changes, ultimately have had surprising and often undesirable effects on individual countries.

#### Global Trade

Since 1993, the type of crops are traded have not changed much. Despite what social media might make you believe, super-food have not completely changed what people produce, trade, and consume. Since 1993 the most traded products have by far been wheat, maize, and soybean. While these are staple foods throughout the world, they are not consumed more than other staples like potatoes and rice {LINK}. The real driver behind the trade of these three products is animal feed. INSERT(What percent is used for animal feed).

However, who exports and who imports crops has significantly shifted in the past two decades.

China has become the primary importer of agricultural products by tonnes on the planet, while brazil has risen as a major producer and exporter.

We have seen that China has become the largest importer of agricultural products in the world. But how exactly has China's imports changed? Here is a look at total Chinese imports, between 1993 and 2016.

As we can see Chinese imports skyrocket but their exports stay more or less stable. But what do they import? Here are the 5 products most imported in China in 2016, and their evolution since 1993. Here is a stackplot of imports.

What do they use it for?

#### USA

The first thing that catches our attention is the increase of the Avocados exported from Mexico to the US. Back to 1993, the main exporter of Avocados to the US was Chile, while most of the exports from Mexico went to Europe. The United States had banned  avocados in 1994 to eliminate the threat of Mexican pests, such as the fruit fly. But in 1994, with the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), Mexican avocados entered the American market, alongside Californian avocados that had sustained the country throughout the existence of the ban. An avocado explosion followed: in 2016, 76% of the total exports of Avocados from Mexico went to the US, compared to only 13% in 1994. However, despite this increase in Mexicos’s avocados production, [^1] can Mexico handle the demand of imports to the US? Mexico seems to be facing a “[guacamole crisis](<https://www.dw.com/en/mexico-facing-a-guacamole-crisis/a-49703429>)".

In the EU the demand of Avocados has also explote: from 170 thousands of tonnes in 1994  to 1810 thousands of imports in 2016 (from outside the EU). The main exporters appear to be South Africa, Mexico, Israel and Kenya, and in the most recent years Peru and Chile.

Let’s look deeper into the countries of the EU. If we take a look to the imports, traditionally France was the largest importer, along with the United Kingdom, Germany, the Nehterlands and Spain. Scandinavian countries such as Denmark and Sweeden are much smaller in terms of population, but still appear as one of the highest consumers of avocados due to their strong promotion and the attention to health food.

Spain is the most important producer of avocados in Europe. It was the main exporter of avocados until 2006, when the Netherlands got first in the rank, along with their increase in imports. The Netherlands is the main non-producing exporter of avocados in the world. From there, large volumes are re-exported mainly to countries inside the EU. In 2016, 28.9% of their exports were to Germany, followed by France (10.5%) and Sweden (8%).

Beyond governmental policies, consumer can be a major driving force for agricultural trade. Trending products such as quinoa have become.

The majority of quinoa exports are towards first world economies, mainly the United States and Europe. Quinoa is native to the andean plateau, meaning only Ecuador, Bolivia, and Peru have the adequate climate cultivate it. Until 2010, Worldwide quinoa exports remained under QUANTITY. Bolivia was the major exporter the US and EU, while Peru supplied to these two, and to smaller markets such as Japan, Australia, and New Zealand.
